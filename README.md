## AI Strategy & Technology Leadership | Available for Strategic Roles

### Technical Proficiency

Kieran Bicheno combines deep expertise in AI/ML development, MLOps, and data-driven infrastructure with a background in digital news leadership and economics. He has over ten years of experience designing, deploying, and scaling machine-learning systems and data pipelines, alongside developing production-grade software and self-hosted infrastructure.

### Key Technical Competencies

- **Machine Learning \& AI**:
    - MLOps architecture, automated model training pipelines, and continuous-integration workflows
    - Research contributions in dataset documentation (co-author of “The Pile Datasheet”)[^1]
    - Implementation of local LLM deployments and agentic coding systems (e.g., Llama.cpp, Mistral)
- **Infrastructure \& DevOps**:
    - Design and management of self-hosted GPU clusters (NVIDIA RTX-class hardware) on Ubuntu/Linux
    - Containerization with Docker and orchestration using docker-compose and Kubernetes
    - Secrets-management (Infisical), PostgreSQL configuration, and systemd service automation
- **Programming \& Automation**:
    - Advanced Python development (data pipelines, audio-processing, Google Apps Script)
    - Shell scripting and CLI tooling for ffmpeg, yt-dl integration, and workflow automation (n8n, PM2/Bun)
- **Data Engineering**:
    - Large-scale economic and cosmological data ingestion, statistical analysis, and time-series forecasting
    - API design for Stable Diffusion and cost-push inflation models

## Career Highlights

- Led AI augmentation strategy and digital transformation in high-stress news environments at News Corp Australia, pioneering a Google Apps Script tool that cut a critical workflow from 2 hours to 12 minutes.
- Co-authored the influential “Datasheet for The Pile” paper on arXiv, establishing metadata standards for large language-model datasets.[^1]
- Architected and optimized self-hosted inference environments for LLMs, overcoming PyTorch compatibility issues with RTX 5090 GPUs.
- Directed GenFactory.io’s industrial-scale Stable Diffusion API platform, integrating data-driven image generation at production scale.

## Open-Source Contributions
GitHub profile showcases a broad range of repositories spanning AI/ML prototypes, tooling for self-hosting, data-analysis libraries, and multimedia processing utilities. Highlights include:

- MLOps pipeline templates for training and deploying transformer models
- Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts for GPU-accelerated inference
- Audio-visual production scripts and video-processing workflows

## Reputation \& Credibility

- Recognized contributor on The Pile project, with research cited in academic and industry contexts.
- Former head of digital news at News Regional Media (News Corp), lauded for crisis leadership and analytics-driven decision-making.
- Engaged consultant in AI ethics and governance, advising on human-readable specification formats and ethical deployment frameworks.

## Selected Publications \& Projects

- “Datasheet for The Pile” – co-author, [arXiv:2201.07311](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07311)
- Independent MLOps research on autonomous systems control and workforce augmentation (2020–2021)
